Wonderland
==========

Wonderland is a simple blogging template for Jekyll/GitHub Pages that includes social integrations with Twitter, GitHub, Dribbble, Instagram, Last.fm, and SoundCloud. 

This is a port of @rigoneri's [syte](https://github.com/rigoneri/syte), which runs on Python. Unlike syte, Wonderland serves up entirely static pages and uses client-side javascript to call the external APIs, which allows you to deploy your blog on GitHub Pages, which is free, easy, and rad.


##### **You can see a live demo [here](http://ajb.github.io/wonderland/)**.


## Usage

1. Fork this repo

2. Edit variables in _config.yml

3. Remove my _posts/ directory and add your own blog posts

4. Remove my contact/index.md page and add your own static pages (and update the nav in _includes/header.ext)

5. Push your changes to GitHub and the site will automatically build

### Inspiration & Credits

A ton of this code is pulled from @rigoneri's [syte](https://github.com/rigoneri/syte). Credit also to @mertemin for [purus](https://github.com/mertemin/purus), a handy extraction of syte's core stylesheets.
